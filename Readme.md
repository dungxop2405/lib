### Composable OpenCV heroku buildpack

Copy pasted vulcan build from Labgoo:
https://bitbucket.org/labgoo/heroku-buildpack-nodejs-with-opencv

Also copy pasted from @rumblelabs:
https://github.com/rumblelabs/heroku-buildpack-cairo

Should at least work with `heroku-buildpack-nodejs` + the `after_compile` fork of `heroku-buildpack-multi` by salsify:
https://github.com/salsify/heroku-buildpack-multi

Have fun!
